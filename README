    This is a generic data migrating tool. It supports an array of different input sources (ingress handlers)
and an array of different output destinations (egress handlers). These ingress and egress handlers can work
together and be mix-matched to suit your input/output needs.

    I have supplied some sample jobs to show how to operate each type of ingress and egress handler. If you
notice a bug or have an idea for a new ingress/egress handler, let me know and show some code.
